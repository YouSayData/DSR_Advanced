# Exercise ----------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Write a map / loop that simulates 6 out of 49 lotto (without super ball).
# The sequence for the loop is 1:k where k is the number of weeks a player plays
# The function in the body of the loop simulates playing one field of lotto with random numbers.
# It returns a tibble containing a column for the week played and a column showing how many numbers the player had correct.
# Collect all the integers so you can plot them over the weeks played.

# 2. Run it for 100 weeks, bind the results to a tibble and visualise it.


# This doesn't scale well to higher k -------------------------------------


# furrr and future --------------------------------------------------------
